# NotepadAI - App

Mobile phone app for the NotepadAI project.

## About NotepadAI
Semesterproject SS2019 - [CODE University of Applied Sciences](https://code.berlin/en/)

##### How might we...
support students in taking the most out of a lecture?

To achieve this we are building a mobile app using Flutter which records a lecture, transcripts it and helps the student summarize it.

## Purpose
This is the actual app which will connect to the [NotepadAI Backend](https://gitlab.com/julian.bertsch42/notepadai_backend/blob/master/README.md).
It allows you to start recording a lecture and send the audio stream from the microphone to our server where it will get processed and sent back to the phone.
